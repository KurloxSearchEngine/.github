# The _Why_

While Google and other popular search engines work well, they are centralized. This raises concerns about user privacy, monopolistic practices, censorship, and the ability for such entities to unilaterally manipulate search results. Kurlox addresses these issues by exploring a different kind of search engine architecture: _complete trustless decentralization_. In this model, the database of websites and the methods to query them are partitioned across $n$ user-run and independently governed nodes. As a result, no single entity is responsible for — or capable of — exerting complete control over the network.

There's more to it... but we'll leave it at that for now.
